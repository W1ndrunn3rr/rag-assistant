![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg) 
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-green.svg) 

**RAG Assistant** is a project for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant, leveraging the **DeepSeek R1** model via the **DeepSeek API**. The backend is built using **FastAPI**, and the frontend is developed with the **Vite + React** stack. The project is hosted on **Vercel** (frontend) and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** (backend). The RAG mechanism is powered by **LangChain** and **LangGraph**, and it supports **user-uploaded PDFs** as a source of information for retrieval and generation.

## Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines retrieval-based and generative AI for accurate and context-aware responses.
- **User-Uploaded PDFs**: Allows users to upload PDF documents, which are processed and used as a knowledge base for retrieval and generation.
- **DeepSeek R1 Model**: Utilizes the powerful DeepSeek R1 model for natural language understanding and generation.
- **FastAPI Backend**: A high-performance backend framework for building APIs.
- **Vite + React Frontend**: A modern and efficient frontend stack for a seamless user experience.
- **Hosting on Vercel & GCP**: Frontend hosted on Vercel for fast delivery, and backend on GCP for scalability and reliability.
- **LangChain & LangGraph Integration**: Implements RAG functionality using LangChain and LangGraph for advanced retrieval and generation workflows.

---

## Usage

The RAG Assistant is designed to provide context-aware responses by combining retrieval-based methods with generative AI. Users can upload PDF documents, which are processed and used as a knowledge base. Simply interact with the interface to ask questions or request information based on the uploaded content.

---

## Configuration

Since the project is hosted, no local configuration is required. The backend and frontend are pre-configured for optimal performance on Vercel and GCP.
